<h1> I dont make money from this site, this site is 100% free, even though I would like donations to host a couple things for this site that isnt originally possible, but if you insist on donating, tell me in the chatbox and we can arrange something </h1>
<h1> I know I said the name was "laginx" but im just not gonna name this website</h1>
    <h1> Updates: New proxy, moved to Palladium instead of slow alloy, legit it took like 10 hours for a website to load, oh yeah, and the crazy new ui update which I completely made from scratch (scratch: from nothing, not the scratch block builder thingy) so yeah, enjoy!!</h1>
